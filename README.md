# Gochat

Simple chat application with weird features like a cron job for displaying weather.

### Backend

- Rest API (Golang)

- Websocket Server (Golang?)

### Frontend

- React (Typescript)

### Databases

- Cloud File Storage (Which??)
- Cloud SQL Database (Turso?)
- Cloud NoSQL Database (Mongo atlas?)

### External APIs

Idea: https://openweathermap.org/api

### Cron Job

Idea: Maybe something like sending a message in the chat to with current weather for one or multiple cities...
